-- 🟢 Project Tasks
-- ✅ TASK 1 — Revenue Analysis
-- ❓ Question - Which products generate the highest revenue?
select p.product_name, sum(o.quantity*p.unit_cost) as high_rev
from orders o
join products p
on o.product_id=p.product_id
group by p.product_name;

-- 🟢 TASK 2 — Monthly Revenue Trend
-- ❓ Question --Show monthly revenue.
select date_format(order_date,'%Y-%m') as monthly,
	sum(o.quantity*p.unit_cost) as revenue
from orders o
join products p
on o.product_id=p.product_id
group by date_format(order_date,'%Y-%m');

-- 🟢 TASK 3 — Warehouse Performance
-- ❓ Question -Which warehouse processes most orders?
select w.city, count(*)
from orders o
join warehouses w
on o.warehouse_id=w.warehouse_id
group by w.city;

-- 🟢 TASK 4 — Delivery Performance
-- ❓ Question - Average delivery time.
select avg(datediff(delivery_date,ship_date)) as avg_delivery_time
from shipments
where datediff(delivery_date,ship_date) is not null;

-- 🟢 TASK 5 — Delay Analysis
-- ❓ Question - Delayed shipments.
select order_id, count(*) as delayed_shipments, datediff(delivery_date,ship_date) as delay_days from shipments
where datediff(delivery_date,ship_date) > (select avg(datediff(delivery_date,ship_date)) from shipments)
group by order_id, datediff(delivery_date,ship_date);

select order_id, datediff(delivery_date,ship_date) from shipments;

-- 🟢 TASK 6 — Supplier Analysis
-- ❓ Question --Fastest suppliers.
select supplier_id, avg(lead_time_days) as lead_time
from suppliers
group by supplier_id
order by lead_time;

-- 🟢 TASK 7 — Business Question (Important)
-- ❓ Question - Which warehouse has most delays?
select w.city, count(*) as delays
from orders o
join shipments s
on o.order_id=s.order_id
join warehouses w
on o.warehouse_id=w.warehouse_id
where datediff(delivery_date,ship_date) > 0
group by w.city
order by delays desc;

-- 🟢 TASK 8 — Advanced (Resume Highlight)
-- ❓ Question - Top 3 products by revenue
select * from (
	select p.product_name, sum(p.unit_cost*o.quantity) as sales, 
		rank() over (order by sum(p.unit_cost*o.quantity) desc) as Top_rank
	from orders o
    join products p
		on o.product_id=p.product_id
	group by p.product_name
    order by sum(p.unit_cost*o.quantity) desc) sp
where Top_rank<=3;
